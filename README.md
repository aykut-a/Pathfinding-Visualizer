# Pathfinding Visualizer

 A pathfinding visualizer made in vanilla JS. 
 Live project can be found at [Pathfinding Visualizer](https://aykut-a.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/)
 
 The app uses 4 types of known pathfinding algorithms, namely;
  1. A* Search Algorithms 
  2. Dijkstra's Algorithm 
  3. Deep First Search(DFS)
  4. Breadth First Search(BFS). 
 
 The users get to create the obstacles on their choice, reset the start and end nodes and also there are maze generators included as well.
